**Description:** We have constructed a flask application that is capable of giving the user a detailed 
weather report based on their entered location. <br />
It is able to do this through the use of an API from Herouku a free API website mentioned in class. 
For our code we used a combination of python, html, and css which required a great deal of research 
and careful planning on all our parts seeing as we are largely inexperienced with all three.
